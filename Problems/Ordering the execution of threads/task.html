  <p>Implement a method that takes three objects (instances of <code class="language-java">Thread</code> or its subclasses). The method must start passed objects as threads in a way that the order of their execution goes like this: <strong>t3, t2, t1</strong>. These threads print secret phrases to the standard output, their output must be always the same.</p> 
  <p>All given threads must be terminated before the implemented method is completed.</p> 
  <p>Otherwise, the testing system will give you some hints on throwing exceptions in the main thread, for example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: All threads must be terminated before ending the implemented method</code></pre>
