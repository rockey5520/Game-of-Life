<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Well, now the universe is created, and its laws work properly.</p>

<p>Let’s visualize evolution. In the previous stage, we could see only one generation. It would be better if each generation was displayed. But our perception is not as fast as computer’s, so our application should sleep a little after each generation.</p>

<p>Use methods of the class <code class="java">java.lang.Thread</code> to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>You can do this in two ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>output every generation to the console, one after one</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>clear the console output before the next generation appears</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the cross-platform nature of Java, the second way can be complicated. You can use this code to clear the console output.</p>

<pre><code class="java">try {
    if (System.getProperty("os.name").contains("Windows"))
        new ProcessBuilder("cmd","/c","cls").inheritIO().start().waitFor();
    else
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("clear");
}
catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {}</code></pre>

<p>The only input is a number for the size of the universe. The universe for this stage is a square. Also, in this stage you shouldn't set the seed to generate an initial position, it should be random.</p>

<p>The launched application must show evolution in progress. You should output at least 10 generations before stoppint the application.</p>
