  <p>Implement a method that takes an array of threads. The method must find the first thread that has not been started yet and start it.</p> 
  <p>The found thread must be terminated before the implemented method is completed.</p> 
  <p>The testing system will give you some hints throwing exceptions in the main thread, like:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Found thread must be terminated before ending the implemented method</code></pre>
